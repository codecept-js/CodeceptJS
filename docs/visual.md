# Visual Testing

How does one test if the UI being rendered appears correctly to the users or how to test if each UI element appears in the right position and size? The traditional way to test the UI of the application has always been manually, which is time consuming.

Visual testing with help of CodeceptJS will help in improving such use cases for the QA folks, another example could be if you'd Imagine yourself to be QA of an application that monitors 1000’s of metrics and plots them, 
it would take a huge amount of time for a human eye to compare each metric plot and verify if it’s working as “expected”.

In the modern days of data Intensive analytical applications, it is important to not just test the functionality of the application but also make sure that the data being plotted is not majorly away from the expected result patterns.
 

By default CodeceptJS uses [WebDriver](/helpers/WebDriver/) helper and **Selenium** to automate browser. It is also capable of taking screenshots of the application and this could be used for visual testing.

Currently there are two helpers available for Visual testing with CodeceptJS

## Using Resemble helper

## Using Visual Knight
